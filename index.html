    Back in May, my husband and I hopped on the quarantine sourdough trend with the rest of the world during the beginning phase of the shelter-in-place orders.
    The demand was so high back then it was impossible to find any types of flour or yeast at local grocery stores. So we ended up purchasing a Sourdough Starter Kit from Bien Cuit Bakery from our good ol' neighborhood, Brooklyn, NY.
      <br>
    The kit came with everything a beginner would need, including a piece of starter in a mason jar that the bakery had been fermanting.
    While baking a sourgough is way more complicated than a banana bread, which is pretty much the only thing I know how to bake, my husband found it rather therapeutic.
    </p>

    <p>Five months later, we are keeping the trend going. And by we, I mean my husband... I am just enjoying the freshly baked sourdough as I'm becoming a self-claimed sourdough connoisseuir :).
      After many attempts and lost count of doughs and days, our favorite recipe is Tartine's oat porridge posted by The Perfect Loaf blog.
      If you are new to sourdough baking, I suggest watching youtube videos <a href="https://youtu.be/bSYdABrPrtM" target="_blank">(like this one)</a> before reading this wordy recipe to familiarize yourself with the terms first.
      <br>
      <i>Enjoy!</i>

      Prepare the levain - 6:30AM
    </h2>

            <p>
            Start this first thing in the morning as it will take about 5-6 hours to get ready.
            </p>

            <div class="wrapper">

            </div>

            <p>
              Try to keep the levain somewehre warm in the kitchen, at around 78°F (25°C). We found placing it in the oven with the interior light on works the best!
              When your levain build is ready for use after its ~5 hour rest, first cook your oat porridge
            </p>

    <h2>
      Oat porridge - 11:30 AM
    </h2>

            <P>
              Recommend to cook at a lower heat and only for about 16 minutes to make it creamy and slightly on the liquid side. This will make it easier to fold later when incorporating it into the dough.
            </p>

            <p>
              Gather the following.

                  <div class="box15">15%</div>
            </div>

            <p>
              Then:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>In a thick bowl add your 150g levain</li>
                <li>Add 700g of your total water to your mixing bowl and mix with your hand until the levain is wholly dissolved</li>
                <li>Add in your white and whole wheat flours</li>
                <li>Mix by hand until all the dry ingredients are incorporated</li>
                <li>Cover with wrap and keep covered in a warmish place in your kitchen for 1 hour</li>
            </ol>

    <h2>
      After your 1 hour pseudo-autolyse, add your mass:
    </h2>

            <ol>
              <li>25g sea salt</li>
              <li>25g of the remaining water</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
            Cut the salt through your dough with your hand and mix everything until it comes back together and becomes sticky. <br>
            The mixture might feel strangely stiff, this is normal- do not add any more water here.<br>

            <h4>
              <u>Final dough temperature:</u> 79°F (25°C)
            </h4>
            </p>

    <h2>
      Bulk Fermentation - <b>12:30PM</b>
    </h2>
            <p>
              Transfer your dough to a clear container to be used during bulk fermentation and let rest for the first 30 minutes.
              After the first 30, add in the oat porridge a little bit at a time folding well after each addition. Use your remaining 25g of water a little at a time as you fold.
              <br>
              Now that the porridge is incorporated, perform the first turn set, and each subsequent, in 30-minute intervals.
            </p>
              <ol>
                <li>12:30PM - Turn set 1</li>
                <li>1:00PM - Turn set 2</li>
                <li>1:30PM - Turn set 3</li>
                <li>2:00PM - Turn set 4</li>
                <li>2:30PM - Turn set 5</li>
                <li>3:00PM - Turn set 6</li>
                <li>3:30PM - 6:00PM - Rest on counter untouched</li>
              </ol>
                <p>You'll need to judge when the dough has reached sufficient strength to stop the stretch and folds. Six sets seemed to work for us.
                </p>
    <h2>
      Pre-shape - 6:10PM
    </h2>
            <p>
              Take the dough out of the container onto your work surface and sprinkle some flour on top before dividing. Divide into two halves and lightly scoot the dough in little circles across your work surface with your bench knife in one hand and your other empty hand.
              Let this pre-shape rest, covered with a damp towel or inverted bowls, for 20 minutes.
              <br>
              Lightly dust your proofing bowls with brown rice flour in preparation for the next step.
            </p>

    <h2>
      Shape + Proof - 6:30PM
    </h2>
            <p>
              After each boule is shaped tight and resting on the counter, scrape up the first boule and gently invert and drop onto the resting rolled oats.
              Pick up the boule with both hands and gently lower into the proofing basket, seam side up. Spread out some more rolled oats for the next boule and repeat.
            </p>

    <h2>
      Score + Bake - 9:30AM
    </h2>

            <div class="imagewrap2">

            </div>



            <p>
              The following morning, preheat your oven with Dutch oven inside to 450°F. After one hour, take one of your baskets out of the fridge and cut a piece of parchment paper to place on top.
              Take your peel and then put it on top of those two and quickly invert it, so the dough is now resting on the parchment paper and the peel.
              <br>
              Grab your kitchen shears and score the dough.
              Take out the shallow side of your Dutch oven and drag in your boule. Quickly place the pan back in the oven, cover with the deep side, and bake for 20 minutes. After this time, open the oven and take off the deep lid of the Dutch oven,
              then bake for an additional 35 minutes or so, until the bread is to your desired doneness.
              <br>
              Try as hard as you can to <b>not slice</b> into them when finished baking for at least a couple of hours. The interior remains very delicate and almost gooey until it sets.
